        <ol>
            <li>Pour oil in a pot and begin heating it. You want it to be hot in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place all ingredients into a bowl that can withstand high temperatures. However,
                save about 3 sesame seeds. (For further flavor adjustment, consult the section below.)</li>
            <li>Stir ingredients until they are consistent.</li>
            <li>Toss a single sesame seed into the heated oil.
                <ul>
                    <li>If the seed burns, the oil is too hot. Turn off the fire to let it cool and 
                        test another seed later.</li>
                    <li>If the seed shows no signs of sizzling, the oil is too cold. Continue heating
                        and test another seed later.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the seed sizzles to an ever so slight shade of brown, the oil is at a
                        good temperature. Proceed to step 5.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Pour a small amount of your oil into the bowl and immediately stir the bubbles away.</li>
            <li>Pour a slightly larger amount of your oil into the bowl than before and immediately 
                stir the bubbles away.</li>
            <li>Continue to pour more and more oil into the bowl with stirring until it has all been 
                poured.</li>
            <li>The chili oil will be ready for consumption after it cools!</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Haha. I'm not an expert either. I'd have to ask my uncle.</li>
